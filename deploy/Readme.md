# Weebo's Pipeline V3.2

## What is this?

This is a pipeline that will be used to deploy all my projects (personal and professional).

The V1 was based on a Gitlab CI/CD and Github action pipeline, the V2 was based on Concourse and the V3 use Tekton.

The V3.2 is a new version of the V3, it's a complete rewrite of the V3.1, it's more modular and more flexible and based on Helm. All the secret are setup in the GitOps workflow.

## Secret

This project need some secret to work:

- harbor-auth : This is a docker config that will be used to push the image to the harbor registry and is being generated by the terraform jobs.
- kubeconfig: This a kubeconfig used to deploy and/or upgrade the helm chart, it's being generated by the terraform jobs.
- {{template}}-github-secret : Contains the secret to allow the pipeline to recognize the github repository.

Two more secret is being considered:

- {{template}}-sonarqube-secret : Contains the secret to allow the pipeline to push the code coverage to sonarqube.
- {{template}}-git-ssh-secret : Contains the secret to allow the pipeline to clone the repository.

ATM the remaining secret should be setup with a terraform soon to be made script.
